# E-commerce Sales & Profitability Analysis (2023)

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end analysis of structured e-commerce transactional data to evaluate revenue performance, profitability, category trends, and seasonal patterns.

The goal of this project was to simulate a realistic business analysis workflow using relational data and extract meaningful insights that could support decision-making in a real-world e-commerce setting. The focus was not only on visualization, but on structured reasoning and business interpretation.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is synthetically generated to resemble a real-world e-commerce relational database structure.

It consists of three related tables:

- **Customers** – customer details and regional information  
- **Products** – product categories, pricing, and cost structure  
- **Orders** – transactional sales data including quantity, discount, revenue, and profit  

The relational design allowed for realistic joins and category-level performance analysis, similar to what is encountered in actual business databases.

## Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Revenue & Profitability Analysis

- Computed total revenue and total profit  
- Evaluated overall profit margin  
- Calculated average order value  
- Analyzed revenue contribution patterns  

### 2. Category-Level Performance

- Compared revenue across product categories  
- Evaluated profit contribution by category  
- Measured profit margin efficiency  
- Analyzed the impact of unit price and sales volume  

### 3. Monthly Trend Analysis

- Aggregated revenue month-wise  
- Identified seasonal fluctuations  
- Examined volume-driven revenue changes  

### 4. Seasonal Investigation

- Investigated the August revenue spike  
- Broke down category-level contributions  
- Compared pricing impact versus quantity impact

## Key Insights

- Clothing generated the highest total revenue and profit, primarily driven by higher sales volume.  
- Electronics showed the strongest profit margin efficiency, despite lower overall revenue.  
- Revenue differences across categories were influenced more by unit pricing and quantity sold than by discount variations.  
- August recorded the highest monthly revenue, mainly supported by strong performance in the Home category.  
- July showed relatively lower revenue, suggesting possible seasonal slowdown.

## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was ensuring accurate joins between relational tables without introducing duplication bias in revenue calculations. Careful validation was required to confirm that aggregation results reflected true transactional totals.

Another important aspect was interpreting results beyond surface-level numbers and understanding what was actually driving performance differences.

## Limitations

Since the dataset is synthetic, external real-world factors such as market competition, macroeconomic conditions, and customer behavior dynamics are not incorporated. Therefore, conclusions are limited to the structure and assumptions of the simulated data.

---

## Business Recommendations

- Increase strategic focus on high-margin categories such as Electronics.  
- Study the drivers behind seasonal revenue spikes to replicate similar strategies.  
- Review pricing and cost optimization strategies in lower-margin categories.  
- Develop targeted campaigns for slower-performing months.  

---

## Business Value

This project demonstrates:

- Structured problem-solving using relational datasets  
- Practical revenue diagnostics and profitability analysis  
- Category-level performance evaluation  
- Seasonal trend identification  
- Translation of raw transactional data into business insights  

The emphasis throughout the project was on analytical reasoning and business interpretation rather than only visualization.

## Project Outcome

Through this analysis, I strengthened my understanding of relational data handling, aggregation logic, and business-oriented thinking using Python-based tools. The project reflects a realistic data analyst workflow, from structured data modeling to insight generation.
