# E-commerce Sales & Profitability Analysis (2023)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end analysis of structured e-commerce transactional data to evaluate revenue performance, profitability, category trends, and seasonal patterns.

The objective is to simulate a real-world business analysis scenario and extract actionable insights using Python-based data analytics techniques.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Note
This project uses synthetically generated data designed to simulate a real-world e-commerce relational database structure.  

The dataset consists of three structured tables:

- **Customers** – customer details and regional information  
- **Products** – product details including category and pricing  
- **Orders** – transactional sales data including quantity, discount, revenue, and profit  

The relational design mimics industry-style transactional systems to enable realistic business analysis and category-level performance evaluation.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Clothing** leads in overall revenue and total profit due to higher sales volume.
- **Electronics** shows the highest profit margin efficiency despite lower total revenue.
- Revenue variations across categories are primarily driven by unit price and quantity sold rather than discount differences.
- August recorded the highest monthly revenue, driven mainly by strong performance in the Home category.
- July showed comparatively lower revenue, indicating possible seasonal slowdown.

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Increase promotional focus on high-margin categories such as Electronics.
- Investigate drivers behind seasonal revenue spikes for strategic replication.
- Optimize pricing and cost structures in lower-margin categories.
- Develop targeted strategies for slower-performing months.
